It allows to specify properties and metadata of such layers (e.g. inputs paths, output directory, axes order, etc.) that are used by the Acquisition Function Configuration widget.\nThis widget allows to relate different layers using a single hierarchical structure (image group). Such hierarchical structure is implemented as follows:\n\nImage groups. Used to contain different modes of data from a single object, such as image pixels, labels, masks, etc.\n\nLayers groups. These group multiple layers of the same mode together, e.g. different channel layers of the same image.\n\nLayer channels. This is directly related to elements in napari’s layer list. Moreover, layer channels allow to store additional information or metadata useful for the inference and fine-tuning processes."

It allows to specify properties and metadata of such layers (e.g. inputs paths, output directory, axes order, etc.) that are used by the Acquisition Function Configuration widget.\nThis widget allows to relate different layers using a single hierarchical structure (image group). Such hierarchical structure is implemented as follows:\n\nImage groups. Used to contain different modes of data from a single object, such as image pixels, labels, masks, etc.\n\nLayers groups. These group multiple layers of the same mode together, e.g. different channel layers of the same image.\n\nLayer channels. This is directly related to elements in napari’s layer list. Moreover, layer channels allow to store additional information or metadata useful for the inference and fine-tuning processes."
