Such hierarchical structure is implemented as follows:\n\nImage groups. Used to contain different modes of data from a single object, such as image pixels, labels, masks, etc.\n\nLayers groups. These group multiple layers of the same mode together, e.g. different channel layers of the same image.\n\nLayer channels. This is directly related to elements in napari’s layer list.

For that image we will extract two-dimensional patches of size \\(256\\times256\\) pixels, in the “X” and “Y” spatial axes.\nTherefore, “Input axes”=“ZYX” allows to set the patch size at spatial axes “Y” and “X” to \\(256\\) pixels, and “Z” to \\(1\\) in order to extract one-slice-deep patches.\n\n\n\n\n\nChange the “Model axes” to “CYX”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Model axes\n\n\nThis, on the other hand, specifies the order our model expects to receive its inputs.\nIn his case, the nuclei model from cellpose will be applied to two-dimensional images. Because the “Z” axis is not used, we drop it from the “Model axes” string. This is only possible because the “Z” axis is already set to \\(1\\) slice deep and can be squeezed from the patch.\nAdditionally, we append the “C” (color channel) axis to the beginning of the string. That means that the order of the patch axes will be permuted to have the color channel as leading axis."

For that image we will extract two-dimensional patches of size \\(256\\times256\\) pixels, in the “X” and “Y” spatial axes.\nTherefore, “Input axes”=“ZYX” allows to set the patch size at spatial axes “Y” and “X” to \\(256\\) pixels, and “Z” to \\(1\\) in order to extract one-slice-deep patches.\n\n\n\n\nChange the “Model axes” to “CYX”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout Model axes\n\n\n\n\n\nThis, on the other hand, specifies the order our model expects to receive its inputs.\nIn his case, the nuclei model from cellpose will be applied to two-dimensional images.

This is only possible because the “Z” axis is already set to \\(1\\) slice deep and can be squeezed from the patch.\nAdditionally, we append the “C” (color channel) axis to the beginning of the string.
